"""
Creating a Function
We use the Python related keyword: "def" + name.
Function can be created as follows: "def affaan():".
Code will only work if there is indentation after declaring a function.
For a function to work after declaration it needs to be called or else a blank output screen will be displayed.
Code below after function declaration it is being called as: "{Function Name}()". Indentation is not needed.

def sayhi():
    print("Hello")

# Calls the function we created above
sayhi()

# Program end
